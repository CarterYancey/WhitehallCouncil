# History and the First Century

[These notes were taken using the audio recorder. Not great quality]
## 1. Introduction
The two meanings of history: #History can refer to either 
1. actual happenings in the real world
2. what people write about actual happenings in the real world. (81). 
History is neither bare facts nor subjective interpretations but it's rather the meaningful narrative of events and intentions (82).
## 2. The Impossibility of 'Mere History'
There is not nor can there be any such thing as a bare chronicle of events without a point of view. All history involves selection. History shares this with other knowing. What we call 'facts' always belong in a context of response, perception, and interaction (83).

"Christ died for our sins" is subjective history, but if you strip out all the theology and supernatural elements from that statement you just say "Jesus died" but still history from a certain point of view page eighty-four.

The fact that a human mind has to organize and arrange the material does not falsify history, that's simply what history is.

Three exercises when reading the gospels:
Listening, Interaction, readiness to respond. Because he said they have to do with matters water is simply history and it does guarantee that the task of the historian can never be simply observing and reporting what actually happened so I think he's saying like all of these things are going on what do we read the gospels so that's going to impact the way that we think about and like the history work.

==My present point is simply that al history is interpreted history.==

## 3. This Does Not Mean 'No Facts'

### (i) Critical Realism and the Threat of the Disappearing Object
To discover that a particular writer has a 'bias' tells us nothing whatever about the value of the information he or she presents.

No one's really neutral.

Discovery that Paul was addressing a particular situation and looking at it in a particular way is frequently used to indicate that the passage in question is therefore bureaucratic.

### (ii) The Cause of the Misconception
if you assume that any stories literature that includes miracles is theology and not history then then your presupposing positive is petition

#Procustean: Enforcing uniformity or conformity without regard to natural variation or individuality.

Some Lutherans were scared to do history because it was a "work."
### (iii) Wanted: New Categories
At one level, a plea for modernists to be open to the idea of miracles. On another level, a plea for ordinary Christians to be open to new ways of reading the New Testament. (97)

## 4. Historical Method: Hypothesis and Verification
### (i) Introduction
The Historical Method is just like all other methods of enquiry: build #hypotheses, then verify them with evidence. But there are differences we must inquire as to what makes the good historical #hypothesis as opposed to any other sort.

### (ii) The Requirements of a Good Hypothesis
1. It must include the data
2. It must construct a basically simple and coherent overall picture.
3. Must prove itself fruitful and other related areas; must explain or help to explain other problems

Naturally, there are some challenges:
1. We find that the stack of data to be included is fast and bewildering. in a historical #hypothesis the data are source materials: written documents, inscriptions, artifacts, archeological evidence, and so forth. A mass of material has to be assembled and the historian who wishes for simplicity will find plenty of temptation to leave out half the data in the interests of coherence. Further, Sources have a habit of not telling us what we really wanted to know; they do not explain something which they could take for granted.
2. The construction of an essentially simple historical hypothesis is likewise a major problem. It involves keeping all the key questions in mind continually and refusing to admit a solution in one area that leaves the rest in turmoil or disorder.

One might have thought that being allowed to disagree with Paul would mean a greater degree of objectivity in the results if we are free to disagree with Paul we are free to let him be himself. Neutrality is often simply a smokescreen for an examined prejudice. (103)

fundamentalism is that corporate religious solipsism that cannot bear the thought of a new or revised story.

Scholars have worked with dominant but misleading models of the early church which as we shall see have exercised a major though often unnoticed to influence on the study of Jesus and Paul.

### (iii) Problems in Verification

There is much discussion among philosophers of science as to (a) the relative weight to be attached to different criteria used in the verification of hypotheses and (b) the proper working out in any particular field of what will count as satisfying criteria in itself. How should we balance the needs of simplicity vs explanatory power? In some fields, simplicity should win over inclusion of all the data. But history is unruly; the more one knows about any event, the more complex one realizes it to be. Simplicity is much easier to project onto events when little evidence is to hand. Inclusion of the data is ultimately the more important of the first two criteria. (105)

Treating the evidence seriously means treating the texts as what it is and not as something else. The present debates about the genre and intention of the gospels are particularly germane to this. 

It has been assumed that we know more or less what Jesus's life ministry and self understanding were like and that they were not like the picture we found in the Gospels but hypothesis of this sort are always short on simplicity. We are faced with three factors which militate against this sort of complexity 
1. that comparative chronology the comparative chronological closeness of the Gospels to the subject matter 2
2. the high probability that the earliest Palestinian Christianity continued in many important respects the sort of ministry in which Jesus himself had engaged 
3. 3 the fact that there are several plausible hypothesis about to Jesus which include whole reams of data that was formerly thought impossible to include.

What is to count as satisfying the criterion of simplicity the areas where simplicity might count strongly are in human aims and motivation and the continuity of the person in the same way actions and events simply do have consequences and sequels and apparently odd jump or break in a chain of events invites investigation here we are justified in looking for simplicity.

There is another sort of simplicity whose value is questionable: many hypothesis have been constructed whose simplicity lies in straightforward movements and in unilinear developments of grand ideas. Christianity, it is imagined, began very simply and then developed to increasing complexity. but this is just not true of ideas and how they work. if anything the simpler form is likely to be the developed and polished result of many years of work whereby a complex idea has been patiently tidied up and made more manageable. 
Carson disagrees. Inventions (like say football) start off simple and gradually become more complex as rules and such are added to deal with new encountered situations.

The final problem with hypotheses is that multiple hypotheses can fit the same data. In technical language, the question may be underdetermined.
## 5. From Even to Meaning
### (i) Event and Intention
History then is real knowledge of a particular sort. It is arrived at, like all knowledge, by the spiral of epistemology, in which the story-telling human community launches enquiries, forms provisional judgments about which stories are likely to be successful in answering those enquires, and then tests these judgments by further interaction with data.

History involves not only the study of 'what happened' but also the study of human intentionality.  In #Collingwood's language, this involves looking 'inside' of an event.

#aim: The fundamental direction of a person's life, or some fairly settled subset of that fundamental direction.
#intention: A specific application of the aim in a particular and in principle repeatable situation. It was Paul's aim that he announced Jesus as Messiah across the World. It was his intention as one result of this aim that he should work his way around the Aegean coast.
#motivation: A specific sense on one specific occasion but a certain action or set of actions is appropriate and desirable. jesus's aim was to inaugurate the Kingdom of God. his intention was to go to Jerusalem. where then both of these he was motivated on one particular day to go into the temple and set about overturning tables.

#History includes the study  of aims, intentions, and motivations. 

### (ii) History and Narrative

### (iii) Hisotry and Meaning
There is an debate in philosophy about the meaning of "meaning" \
the meaning of a word following Wittgenstein I think it would be its use in a context where in a positive context it is a juice or potential use in a sentence or potential sentence 
the meaning of a sentence is its place in a store or implicit story
the meaning of a story is its place in a worldview. 

As we have seen frequently #stories relate in a variety of ways to #worldviews they articulate them legitimate them, support them, modify them, and challenge them, subvert them, and even perhaps destroy them. the same story can have different meanings in relation to different worldviews. Meaning is to be found within a context -- ultimately within the context of world views. (117) Meaning can never be separated from the minds of humans who suppose it and can never simply be reduced to terms of those humans themselves.

## 6. Historical Study of First-Century Religious Movements
### (i) Introduction
Religious here means: They believed in a god who was actively involved in their personal and corporate lives who had intentions and purposes and was capable of carrying them out through both willing and uncomprehending human agents as well as natural forces

### (ii) Judaism in the First Century
Recent study of first century Judaism has rightly stressed its plot of formality but the readiness is to accept a platform and it can degenerate into a kind of atomistic positivist there could be no going back to the teacher organizations that characterize earlier scholarship

### (iii) Christianity in the First Century
Ditto. Also, characterization of Christianity in terms of its expectation of the imminent end of the world and its anxiety and change of mood when this expectation is disappointed or grossly distorted. Christianity also was not seen as a religion early Christians were done to atheists therefore when we look at the history of what we call 1st century religious movements such as Judaism and Christianity it is vital that we look for the inside of the events the aims the intentions and the motivations of the people involved.
