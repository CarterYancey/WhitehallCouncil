#Postmodernism may soon enter into mainline Biblical scholarship [[Chapter 3]]. 
"The #postmodern critique of the Enlightenment itself does not invalidate the modern project." (10)

Literary concerns  to be answered in [[Chapter 3]]. (11)
Methodological issues  to be answered in [[Chapter 4]]. (11-12)
None of these kinds of studies can be done with a detached, #positivistic 'objectivity' to be defended in [[Part II]].

What was the early church really like? What were its main movements? How did it change form being a small Jewish sect to a large multi-cultural group? These to be answered in [[Part IV]].

All history involves selection, arrangement and so on, so the idea of a 'neutral' or 'objective' history is a figment of post-Enlightenment imagination to be defended in [[Chapter 4]].

An argument against the essentially #positivist position will be made in [[Part II]]. (19)

The rise of #postmodernist #literarycriticism in [[Chapter 3]]. (25)

How will Literary Criticism avoid the slide into subjectivism? See [[Chapter 3]]. (26)

#Positivism in [[Chapter 2]] (27)

There is no such thing as a god's-eye view for humans; on the significance of different views of god/God within this arguments, see Chapter 5 (36).

What worldviews are and how they work in [[Chapter 5]] (37).

We will see in [[Part 4]] there's a particular oddity about placing New Testament theology as a norm over against Jesus himself as classically done by #Bultmann (22).

All worldviews contain an irreducible narrative element which stands alongside other worldview elements such as: symbol, praxis, and basic questions and answers -- to be argued in [[Chapter 5]]

The role of hypothesis and verification in discussing history, [[Chapter 4]]

\\ Still need to do -> for Chapter 3.

Atomist, non theological reading of Judaism to be discussed in Part III. (87).
