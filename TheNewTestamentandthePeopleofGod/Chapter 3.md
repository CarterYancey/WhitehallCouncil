# Literature, Story, and the Articulation of Worldviews

## 1. Introduction
We must inquire 
1. what literature does 
2. how it works 
3. how best to treat it

The question 'what should one do with the New Testament' is a special case of the general question 'what should one do with any book?'

We need to answer highly specialized questions about knowledge as it relates to literature:
1. What is going on when a reader encounters a text?
2. What is literature itself?
	1. This will lead us to look in more detail at the way in which stories function
3. How does this apply to the New Testament?

How open is a text to new ways of being read? What would count as a 'correct' reading and how important is it to try to achieve such a thing? What difference does it make if we read the text as part of 'holy scripture'? (49-50).
