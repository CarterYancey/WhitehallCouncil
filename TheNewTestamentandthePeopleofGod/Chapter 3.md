# Literature, Story, and the Articulation of Worldviews

## 1. Introduction
We must inquire 
1. what literature does 
2. how it works 
3. how best to treat it

The question 'what should one do with the New Testament' is a special case of the general question 'what should one do with any book?'

We need to answer highly specialized questions about knowledge as it relates to literature:
1. What is going on when a reader encounters a text?
2. What is literature itself?
	1. This will lead us to look in more detail at the way in which stories function
3. How does this apply to the New Testament?

How open is a text to new ways of being read? What would count as a 'correct' reading and how important is it to try to achieve such a thing? What difference does it make if we read the text as part of 'holy scripture'? (49-50).

## 2. On Reading
### (i) Introduction

### (ii) 'Is There Anybody There?'

==The aim of criticism is to describe the effect of a piece of writing and show how that affect is achieved (55).== 

#NaiveRealism and #Phenomenalism 
#NewCriticism 

Can we say that the author intended to create this or that effect and plotting the effect we have observed? Are we reading the author's mind? Is there anybody there? 

#Composite-criticism: what was Luke doing in writing his work as a whole 
#Narrative-criticism: Never mind Luke. What is this book as a whole doing in itself? Page 56 

If the study of the focus falls on the text itself, what is to be said about the text if we were not to smuggle in authorial intention?
1. It is possible that the writer was writing at an unconscious level. We may actually know more about the author than could have been present to his or her own mind at the time. 56.
2. The text might serve as evidence for the deep structure of all human thoughts which then becomes the real object of critical inquiry. 56. #Structuralism
3. There may exist over and above the author's meaning a *sensus plenior* by which an inspired text actually says more than the author realized at the time, with the holy spirit filling in the blank of authorial ignorance or bringing about an unintended prophecy. The recognition of such a sense has at various stages of the church's reading of scripture been ways of allowing for the experience of Christians at the book will text speaks to them in ways that the author might not have imagined (57). ==This last proposal is found within the New Testament itself== (58).

### (iii) Reading and Critical Realism

What we need is a #CriticalRealist account of the phenomenon of reading itself in all its parts (61).

#HermeneuticOfLove: love does not seek to collapse the beloved into terms of itself, and even though it may speak of losing itself in the beloved, such a loss always turns out to be a true finding. In the familiar paradox, one becomes fully oneself when losing oneself to another. Both parties are simultaneously affirmed. When applied to reading texts, this means that the text can be listened to on its own terms without being reduced to the scale of what the reader can or cannot understand at the moment. If it is puzzling, the good reader will pay it the compliment of struggling to understand it, of living with it and continuing to listen. But however close the reader gets to understanding the text, the reading will still be peculiarly that reader's reading; the subjective is never lost, nor is it necessary or desirable that it should be at this level. Love will mean attention the willingness to grow and change oneself in relation to the other.

What I'm advocating is a critical realism, though I would prefer to describe it as an epistemology or hermeneutic of love (64).

## 3. On Literature

Literature the telling of #stories which bring #Worldviews views into articulation.

The #Positivist critic will seek to locate literature within a particular historical context. He will attempt a full and objective description of what it meant at the time. The apparent success of such a project made lure the unwary and to thinking that positive him has proved its point until other commentaries are consulted were equally objective -- but quite different -- accounts are offered. These may of course enter into dialogue with the one another, but once they start doing so they are already admitting that positivism is not as simple as it looks. 66

The #Phenomenalist reads the parable and finds herself addressed by it. Though she realizes that it may have a historical context, what matters is what it says to her today. What this sort of reading cannot do is claim any sort of normativity; just because the text says this to me, there is no reason why it should say it to you. The claim 'This parable means this and that to me' is of no more public significance than 'I like salt.'' ==The phenomenalist purchases the apparent to certainty and security of her statements in relation to the text at the high cost of forfeiting public relevance== (66).

#CriticalRealist reads the story in light of all sorts of other stories that we habitually carry about with us. That is to say, in light of our fundamental #worldview. Nevertheless, it is precisely part of this worldview that there exists other stories and that they may reaffirm, modify, or subvert some or all of the stories we have been telling ourselves. ==The critical realist reading seeks to be true to itself and to the public world while always open to the possibility of challenge, modification and subversion== (67).

In Judaism and Christianity, there are two types of stories: (67)
1. Stories which embody and articulate a worldview even though it is clear that the stories do not refer to events which happened in the public world. For example, parables 
2. Stories which embody and articulate the worldview by telling what has more or less actually happened in the public domain, since that is what the worldview purports to explain.

## 4. The Nature of Stories

In light of the entire argument so far it would be clearly quite wrong to see these #stories as mere illustrations of truths that could in principle have been articulated in a pure more abstract form. If it is true that all #worldviews are at the deepest level shorthand formula to express stories this is particularly clear in the case of Judaism. To boil off an abstract set of propositions as though one were thereby getting to a more foundational statement would actually be to falsify this worldview. This is not to say that we cannot use shorthand phrases and words to refer to a complex story-form worldview; such phrases are a way of summoning into the mind's eye an entire worldview. For example many theological terms like 'monotheism' are late constructs, convenient short-hands for sentences with verbs in them (ie stories) (78).
