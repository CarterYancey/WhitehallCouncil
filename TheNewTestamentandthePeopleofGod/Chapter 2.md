# 'Knowledge: Problems and Varieties'

## 1. Introduction
The inner rationale of this part of the book is the sense that the problems which we encounter in the study of literature, history and theology all belong together. The basic argument I shall advance in this part of the book is that ==the problem of knowledge itself and of the three branches of it that form our particular concern (literature, history and theology) can all be clarified by seeing them in light of a detailed analysis of the #worldviews which form the grid through which humans perceive all of reality.== (32)

## 2. Towards Critical Realism
#CriticalRealism 
#Positivism 
#NaiveRealism 

The evidence for Caesar's crossing the Rubicon is ultimately of the same order as the evidence that what I am holding is a book. If we do not recognize this fundamental similarity, we may find ourselves ignoring Cartesian doubt in everyday life and embracing it uncritically for more serious issues. the same problems of New Testament theology pertain to a vast range of ordinary human knowledge. including the implicit claim that knowledge requires empirical verification. (34)

#Phenomenalism 

Critical awareness reveals three things about the process of knowing, all of which challenge either #naiverealism or mainline #positivism: (36)
	1. the observer is looking from one point of view. There's no such thing as a God's eye view (for humans).
	2. all humans interpret information received from their senses through a grid of expectations. #Worldviews.
	3. Where I stand has a great deal to do with the communities to which I belong. every human community shares certain assumptions, traditions, expectations, etc. ==There is no such thing as a neutral or objective observer. There is no such thing as a detached observer.==

## 3. Stories, Worldviews, and Knowledge
#Story #Worldview
First century Jews, like all other people, perceived the world and events within the world within a grid of interpretation and expectation. Their particular grid consisted at its heart of their belief that the world was made by a good, wise, and omnipotent God who had chosen Israel as his special people. They believed that their national history (their communal and traditional story) supplied them with lenses through which they could perceive events in the world and make some sense of them and order their lives accordingly (41).

#Worldviews and the #stories which characterize them are in principle normative; that is, they claim to make sense of the whole of reality (41).

==The #positivist and #phenomenalist traditions are wrong to imagine that perception is prior to the grasping of larger realities (43).==

## 4. Conclusion
The hard and fast distinction between objective and subjective must be abandoned as useless. What is needed is a more nuanced epistemology. The #CriticalRealism offered here is therefore essentially a relational epistemology as opposed to a detached one. The stories through which it arrives at its potentially true account of reality are irreducibly stories about the interrelation of humans and the rest of reality. This model allows fully for the actuality of knowledge beyond that of one's own sense data (that which the objectivist desires to save) while also fully allowing for the involvement of the knower in the act of knowing (that upon which he was subjectivist rightly insists). Critical-realist theory of knowledge and verification acknowledges the essentially storied nature of human knowing. It acknowledges that all knowledge of reality is external to oneself and takes place within the framework of the worldview, of which stories form a central part. (44-45).
