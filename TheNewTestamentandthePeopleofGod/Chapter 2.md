# 'Knowledge: Problems and Varieties'

## 1. Introduction
The inner rationale of this part of the book is the sense that the problems which we encounter in the study of literature, history and theology all belong together. The basic argument I shall advance in this part of the book is that ==the problem of knowledge itself and of the three branches of it that form our particular concern (literature, history and theology) can all be clarified by seeing them in light of a detailed analysis of the #worldviews which form the grid through which humans perceive all of reality.== (32)

## 2. Towards Critical Realism
#CriticalRealism 
#Positivism 
#NaiveRealism 

The evidence for Caesars crossing the Rubicon is ultimately of the same order as the evidence that what I am holding is a book. If we do not recognize this fundamental similarity, we may find ourselves ignoring Cartesian Dell in everyday life. and embracing it uncritically for more serious issues. the same problems of New Testament theology pertain to a vast range of ordinary human knowledge. including the implicit claim that knowledge requires empirical verification. (34)

#Phenomenalism 

Critical awareness reveals three things about the process of knowing, all of which challenge either #naiverealism or mainline #positivism: (36)
	1. the observer is looking from one point of view. There's no such thing as a God's eye view.
	2. all humans interpret information received from their senses through a grid of expectations. #Worldviews.
	3. Where I stand has a great deal to do with the communities to which I belong. every human community shares and chances certain assumptions, traditions, expectations, etc. ==There is no such thing as a neutral or objective observer. There is no such thing as a detached observer.==
