#Bultmann #Bultmannian: 
Doing the historical work in order to move beyond it to an ultimate ultimate truth, which is beyond space and time outside history altogether. Such a timeless theology is then the real object of the historical quest. ==If and when we discover what the beliefs of the New Testament writers were we can unearth the essential structure of Christianity.== Theology then becomes the real thing that the New Testament is about. The problem is it is very difficult to produce a theology from the New Testament that is couched in timeless categories. All of the New Testament is culturally conditioned. (20)

#CriticalRealism :
A theory about how people know things (32). It acknowledges the reality of the thing known as something other than the knower, while also fully acknowledging that the only access we have to this reality lies along appropriate dialogue between the knower and the thing known. (35) Sometimes called #HermeneuticOfLove or #EpistemologyOfLove (64).

#Hypothesis #Hypotheses :
Construct thought up by a human mind which offers itself as a story about a particular set of phenomena ,in which the story, which is bound to be an interpretation of those phenomena, also offers an explanation of them.

#NaiveRealism: 
People assume they know things 'straight' (33).  Imagines itself to have direct access to the event or object spoken of in the text (54). See #Positivism. 

#NewCriticism :
An attack on that style of criticism which seeks to unearth from the work under consideration details about the life habits, emotions and so forth of the author. Much modern study of literature has simply rejected the idea that we have access to the mind or intention of a writer. ==The road to hell is paved with authorial intentions.== All we have is the work itself seen as an independent entity (55). #CSLewis vs #Tillyard

#Phenomenalism #Phenomenalist : 
The only thing of which I can really be sure when confronted by things and the external world are my own sense data. (34)  Realizes that it can only be sure of the author's viewpoint (54).

#Positivism #Positivist: 
There are some things which we can have definite knowledge. They are simply 'objectively' true. These are things which can be tested 'empirically'. ==Things that cannot be tested in this way cannot be spoken of without talking some sort of nonsense.==  (32-33)

#Postmodernism #Postmodern: 
What matters is 'what the text says to me' (54). #Barthes #Derrida  #Rorty #Fish

#Story #Stories: 
A key element within the construction of a #Worldview. Located on the map of human knowledge at a more fundamental level than explicitly formulated beliefs, including theological beliefs. (38). ==Stories are the agents that invest 'events' with 'meaning' (79). ==

#Structuralism : 
Going from the text to deep structures of thought and from there to conclusions about a reality which lies beyond ordinary consciousness. The attempt to get behind the phenomena to analyze what is really there. (57) \[Yung?] Even ardent structuralists want to maintain that their books mean and intend certain things and not certain other things (58).
