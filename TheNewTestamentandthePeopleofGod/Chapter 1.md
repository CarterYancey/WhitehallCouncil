# Christian Origins and the New Testament

## (i) Introduction

There is tension between two extremes: reading the NT historically vs theologically.

Can't ignore the "religious, theological, and spiritual aspects of the NT...and that because there is such a thing as fundamentalism we must avoid it...on the other hand, then, we have a justifiable insistence on the importance of history...on the other, a justifiable insistence that historical description by itself is incomplete." (5)

Four ways to interpret an example parable:
1. pre-critical (7)
	solo-scriptura
	critiques: doesn't take the text seriously historically, fails to integrate it into NT theology as a whole, it is insufficiently critical of its own presuppositions.
2. Historical (7-8)
	Concerned with 3 types of questions:
		historical criticism of the gospels
		form- and source-criticism
		redaction-criticism
	Questions are questions like:
		Did Jesus actually tell the parable? What did he mean by it?
		Are there other stories like it in the Jewish background?
		How did early church use this parable?
		Was the parable created out of nothing to meet needs which remained unmet by actual saying of Jesus?
		How is it used in its gospel?
		Has the writer altered it and adapted it for his own purposes?
	Three challenges to historical method:
		Its not clear how the text has authority.
		Doesn't answer theological questions
		Overoptimistic to think we can arrive at 'objective' historical truth.
3. theological (8)
	Asks questions like:
		What is the underlying theology of the parable
		What Christology is implied by the parable?
		How does it fit into the writer's theology?
	Critique:
		"it must attend more carefully to the process involved in its own reading"
4. #postmodern (9)
	Questions like:
		What are we doing when we read the text?
		What do I bring to the text?
		How am I changed through reading it?
	Critique:
		Gives up on the possibly of finding out about God, or Jesus, or the early Christians.

Tension between "normative" and "faithful to history" (9). ==The sharp distinction between the supernatural and the rational is itself a product of Enlightenment thinking. (10)==

***
**Questions this project wants to answer: (10)
	1. How did Christianity begin
	(and) Why did it take the shape it did?
	2. What does Christianity believe?
	(and) Does it make sense?

## (ii) 'The Questions'
The two questions above divide into more ofc.
Literary questions:
	How do you read the texts appropriately?
	How do you tell that you are reading the texts appropriately?
Historical questions:
	Who was Jesus?
	Was he responsible for Christianity?
	Was Paul the real founder of Christianity?
	What were Paul's belief systems?
	Why are the Gospels what they are?
	Is the New Testament normative for Christianity? (this may be Carter's bad reading of Wright)
Theological questions:
	In what way ought Christian theology be what it was in the beginning?
	Is such continuity possible?
	What counts as normative Christianity?
		How do we know?
	Is there a worldview available to modern Christians which is in continuity with early Christians?
	*What should we mean by the word 'god' or 'God'?*

We can't help but mix the Historical questions with the Theological ones. =="studying the theology of the NT depends on some belief, however vague, that certain things that happened in the first century are in some sense normative or authoritative for subsequent Christianity." (14)==

## (iii) 'The History of Early Christianity'
Meaning the worldviews and belief-systems of professing Christians between 30 and 130 AD. The NT is an obvious source, but reconstructing the theology of early Christianity will also include the reconstruction of the theologies of those whose own writings have not been preserved. This is hard because there isn't a lot of data. There are tools for this and it is a "public operation" (14-15)

For many, the religious experience of the early Christians is the normative element within Christianity. This gives the advantage that if you can "objectively" determine what they believed you are now in touch with what Christianity is supposed to be. This fits with the view that the Bible is not itself revelation but is the witness to God's revelation within history. ==On this view, the NT is 'authoritative' because it is the set of documents closest to the facts. (16). ==

If early Christianity is to function in any way as a norm, there is a selection criteria problem; something that distinguishes "right" Christianity from "wrong" Christianity. Either elevate the earliest period on grounds of it being purer, or choose another criteria (for example, Pauline corpus). (17)

Thus a simple historical description of early Christianity and its theology cannot be a complete enterprise, albeit a vital part of the task. It purports to have a simple and clear-headed agenda, but there are problems: (18)
	It tends towards positivism or idealism, or an uncomfortable union of the two
	Question begging nature of choosing supposedly normative samples
	Difficulty abstracting from first-century context into other cultures and times.

## (iv) 'New Testament Theology'

==New Testament Theology is the attempt to read the New Testament from a historical point of view== and to draw its major theological emphasis together into a coherent statement which can then address subsequent generations. 

There can be no guarantee in advance, unless we adopt an unthinking *a priori*, that theologies of the different writers will be the same. (19)

Emphasis on New Testament theology came during the Protestant reformation. The problem is, either it could be shown that the historical sense of scripture was in fact false, calling the veracity of Christianity as a whole into question or one could explore the historical meaning in order to extract from it timeless theological truths. How can the historical and the normative readings be combined? In other words, is New Testament theology in its combined sense of viable proposition? (20)

Two methods for the #Bultmannian paradigm: (20)

#Demythologization
		The attempt to move away from the culture space 1st century forms of speech and thought. in which the Englishman. message. or call. Was clothed?
#FormCriticism
		The means of analyzing. material. which add face value offers historical narratives about Jesus and such. a way is to let it reveal the timeless faith of the early church.

Biblical theology model: 
	The New Testament is given authority not because it witnesses to timeless truth, ==but because it witnesses to the mighty acts of the creator God within history.==
	The text is revelatory and authoritative insofar as it bears witness to the real thing, that is, to the events. 
	Does not do justice to the Protestant insistent on the text itself being Divine revelation. 
	Cannot on its own determine which events are to count as a revelation, or provide a clear theological account of how such a revelation is to be conceived.

The largest problem faced by New Testament theology, particularly within the #Bultmannian paradigm: What to do with Jesus? The New Testament does not contain any writings of Jesus. It could be possible that it merely reflects the beliefs of the writers about Jesus. What if those beliefs are expressed mythologically in terms of Jesus stories? (22)

It has been customary to say that the New Testament writers did not think they were writing scripture. Their own work was conceived as derivative from and dependent upon that fact. If the New Testament does not contain the decisive proclamation of Jesus, it cannot itself be the 'be all end all' of divine revelation, the ultimate locus of authority, *the* thing that all study of the New Testament is bent towards finding. (23)

Why attempt New Testament theology if it is so full of problems?
	1. Protestants regard the New Testament as the real authority. 
	2. The philosophical context of much of this work has been #Idealism. So theology attains a privileged status. If the New Testament is authoritative, this authority has been deemed to lie in the theology that it contains 
	3. The practical context has been the church's perceived task of addressing with itself and the wider world with a word from the true God.

==Within any traditional Christian scheme all authority belongs ultimately to the creator god.== If all authority belongs to the Crater God, it is a matter of some delicacy to describe how such authority comes to be vested in the New Testament. And what the limits of this might be. (24)

## (v) Literary Criticism

A recent step from source-, form-, and reduction-criticism into postmodernist literary criticism. What we're doing there is observing how readers appropriate things for themselves. This provides a new way of being #Bultmannian. It is an attempt to accomplish within postmodernity what Bultmann's package failed to accomplish within modernity. This method has the  inestimable advantage that it begins from and studies the known (actual texts) instead of the unknown (early Christianity, as it may be reconstructed from between the lines of the New Testament). (25)
it is not clear from within this model. why one should be reading the New Testament. It is also not clear what continuing status the model gives to history, nor why one should focus on literature specifically. ==How will this method avoid the slide into subjectivism?==
## (vi) The Task Revisited

We need to do justice simultaneously to: 
	1. #Wrede's emphasis on serious history. 
	2. #Boltzmann's emphasis on normative theology 
	3. The #postmodern emphasis on the text and its readers.

This volume argues for a particular way of doing history, theology and literary study in relation to the questions of the 1st century. It argues for a particular way of understanding 1st century Judaism and 1st century Christianity. It offers a preliminary discussion of the meaning of the word 'god' within the thought forms of these groups.
